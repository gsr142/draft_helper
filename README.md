## Description
This web app was created with python and streamlit. Use it to track your fantasy football draft. Use the default player rankings, or upload your own custom csv file. Select your team, add keepers, then give each team a custom name.  

## Installation
Ensure that python is installed on your machine, clone the repository, navigate to the directory where app.py is stored. Use the command pip install pandas streamlit. Then use the command streamlit run app.py

## Usage
Decide to use the default rankings or upload your own. If you use your own, ensure that you match the columns in your csv file using the onscreen sample. Click on the Start/Reset draft button, then select your team, add keepers/rounds using the menu on the sidebar. You can then add custom teamnames. To select a player, you can use the filters to search by player, team, or position, or click the checkbox next to the player's name and rank on the table. Or just select a player from the dropdown menu. then click on the Select Player button. If a mistake is made, click undo last pick. Have fun.
